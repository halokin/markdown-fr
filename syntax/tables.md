#Arrays

Arrays are not part of teh hart of Mardown spec, but they are part of the GFM (GitHub Flavored Markdown) and Markdown Here support them.

Here is an exemple of an array with teh results here under:

    | arrays       | are             | Cool |
    | ------------ |:---------------:| -----:|
    | col 3 is     | right aligned   | $1600 |
    | col 2 is     | centered        |   $12 |
    | zebras       | are swag       |    $1 |


| Arrays        | are             | Cool |
| ------------- |:---------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right aligned   | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered        |   $12 |
| zebras        | are swag        |    $1 |

Two dots can be used to align the columns

Columns are optionnal et yo don't need the raw to perfectly align. You can also use inline Markdown.

Exemple:

    Markdown | pretty | ugly
    --- | --- | ---
    *appears* | `always` | **fine**
    1 | 2 | 3
